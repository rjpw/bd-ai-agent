# bd-ai-agent

This repo contains my solution for the AI Agent Boot.dev course, such as it is.

At this moment I'm just getting started on it, so not only is it incomplete, it is sub-optimal. It's really here so I can easily bounce between laptops.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Google AI API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python main.py "Your prompt here"
   ```
